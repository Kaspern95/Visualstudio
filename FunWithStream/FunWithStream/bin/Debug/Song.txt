Hope can drown lost in thunderous sound
Fear can claim what little faith remains
But I carry strength from souls now gone
They won't let me give in
I will never surrender
We'll free the Earth and sky
Crush my heart into embers
And I will reignite...
I will reignite
Death will take those who fight alone
But united we can break a fate once set in stone
Just hold the line until the end
Cause we will give them hell
I will never surrender
We'll free the Earth and sky
Crush my heart into embers
And I will reignite...
I will reignite
